### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - <ins>Current skills:</ins> 
    Git, GitHub and VSCode: Initialising a git repository, basic Git workflow using Git commands (tracking changes locally). Working with GitHub which includes setting up a remote repository on GitHub and connecting a local repository to GitHub. Pushing changes from local repository to GitHub. Forking, cloning and downloading an existing remote repository. Using text editor VSCode for writing and managing code. 
    HTML5: HTML Boilerplate, naming conventions using elements, tags and attributes, HTML semantics, hyperlinks, accessibility and embedding, organising content using tables and lists.
    CSS3: CSS basics which includes linking CSS to a HTML document, CSS syntax and structure, CSS selectors, the box model, basic styling with fonts and colors, CSS positioning, CSS specificity and inheritance, combining selectors in CSS, CSS pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements.
    - Ability to hyperfocus and creative problem-solving: ADHD leads me to intense periods of productivity and deep work. Along with my ability to think outside the box and solve complex problems. My strongest subjects in high school were mathematics and physics.
    - <ins>Skills I need to improve:</ins> Applying CSS well is a big challenge. More specifically, CSS animations, layout using Flexbox and Grid, media queries and how to create designs that adapt to different screen sizes. I need much more practice with CSS.
    - Time management and prioritisation: ADHD results in executive dysfunction. Therefore, I struggle with time management leading to missed deadlines and unfinished projects. 

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - <ins>Interests:</ins>Its too soon to say what interests me most as the field of software development is quite broad (back-end, front-end, full-stack etc.). I have recently started my journey in the tech industry, and so far, I am leaning towards front-end development. I enjoy wrestling with code to create vibrant web pages because I am naturally creative and it's incredibly rewarding and encouraging to see my creations come to life instantly. This field gives my ADHD brain the stimulation it craves because not only is it creative but it also involves constantly learning new things and once a problem is solved, there is always a brand new one to tackle- it is a continuous cycle of dopamine rush. It is the oposite of monotonous work which I dislike and struggle to sustain. I enjoyed mathematics in high school and I see clear similarities between mathematics and software development. 
    - <ins>Values:</ins> I was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety which I take medication for. So its very important for me to be in a workspace that is supportive, serene and empowering. It should be a workplace that is committed to employee well-being (mental and physical health). I value an environment that embraces the growth-mindset. 

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - <ins>Industries or roles I have researched:</ins> Softserve is a company based in Gauteng that piqued my interest.
    - <ins>Any particular areas that piqued my interest.</ins> This company specializes in mobile app development, software application development and building websites and have worked with big companies like Nike, Discovery, and Total Sports.

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - <ins>How do these industries/ roles align with my skills, interests, and values:</ins> Softserve piqued my interest because I will have an opportunity work in mobile app development, software application development or building websites. This is Front-end development which is what I am currently learning at CodeSpace and interested in. After completing the course, I will have skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which is needed to land a Junior Software Development role. <i>Softserve</i> has good values which align with mine. They value <i>philotimo</i> which is japanese for deep love of community. I strongly value a workspace that is supportive especially given my mental health. <i>Kaizen</i> (japanese for continious improvement) which aligns with growth-mindset which I value. There is always room for improvement and mistakes are mere learning opportunities not final destinations.
    - <ins>Gaps or areas for further exploration:</ins> I would like to explore their work dynamic between employees and employers abit more. As well as back-end Dbvelopment to see if its something I might prefer. 

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    SMART GOAL:
    - Specific: 75% Average for CodeSpace Software Development course because I want to land a Junior Developer role by next year latest.
    - Measurable: Submit all challenges in the week and not the weekend so that I can ask questions in the coaching sessions. Submitting on time will assist with achieving the end goal, keeping track with lesson plan and google calendar. Goal: score 80% and above for challenges and aim for 80% for big projects.
    - Achievable: Currently, I am quite behind with my course work but there is still time to make up for it because we have only submitted 3 challenges and still have many left to do, including big projects which count the most.
    - Relevant: 75% Average for CodeSpace Software Development course will aid in job opportunities 
    - Time-bound: 75% average by end of course (June). And start applying for jobs this year to land a Junior Developer role at early next year.

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Long-term career aspirations: Further my studies and specialise which will aid in a higher level salary and more job opportunities. Whether it be in Backend Development or Frontend Development. There are good courses at CodeSpace and AIE.
    - How does this align with my interests and skills: CodeSpace has given me a good foundation on frontend development and abit of backend thus I have the basic skills which I can use as good foundation when specialising at another institution. 

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal: Submit all challenges in the week and not the weekend so that I can ask questions in the coaching sessions. Submitting on time will assist with achieving the end goal, keeping track with lesson plan and google calendar. Goal: score 80% and above for challenges and aim for 80% for big projects.
    - Resources or support required: Constant practice. Use SCIMBA, the interactive games more than reading the theory. The mistake I made recently as studying this course as I did my marine science diploma. But Software Development is all about practice. Thus, I will aim for more practice and physical meet-ups on campus for new ways to tackle problems.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Preparations or groundwork necessary for my long-term aspirations: I will need to achieve short-term goal and do well at CodeSpace, then land a Junior developer role which will provide financial aid in furthering my studies and specialising which in turn will allow more job opportunities and higher level salary.
    - Additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed: Qaulification at AIE or specialising qualification at CodeSpace.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Potential obstacles or challenges in reaching my goals: Time-management and perfectionism is my biggest struggle. I tend to over-focus and study hard, not prioritising which wastes time causing me to be behind and miss deadlines which in turn results in anxiety which causes me to be even less productive.
    - Strategies to overcome these challenges: I started ADHD medication when I started this course. I plan to exercise to calm myself and have accountability partners in my class to help keep me on track and to prioritise the topics within the content so I can submit on time and get the desired marks to reach my end goals.

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - CodeSpace offers workshops and networking opportunities which could help broaden my knowledge and job opportunities within the Tech industry.
